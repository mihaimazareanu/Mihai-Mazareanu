# Welcome to my profile.
My name is Mihai and after 18+ years spent in the transport and logistics industry, I am trying to make a carrer change and switch to web development.

That's why I have decided to start a bootcamp with neue fische.

In the next 3 months I am looking to learn the following things:
- tools for front-end development
- tools for back-end development
- how to create APIs
- learn everythingn there is to know about REACT.
