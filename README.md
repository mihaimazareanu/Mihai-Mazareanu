# 🌟 Crafting Digital Experiences: Web Development with Passion!

###👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills to deliver top-notch solutions. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that provide a seamless experience.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- 💻 HTML | CSS | JavaScript
- ⚛️ React | Next.js
- 📦 Node.js | MongoDB | Mongoose

### 📚 Learning and Growing
I believe in the power of continuous learning and keeping up with the latest industry trends. Currently, I'm exploring various frameworks and libraries, such as React and Next.js, to build dynamic and responsive web applications. With Node.js and MongoDB, I can create robust backends and handle data efficiently. Git and GitHub are my go-to tools for version control and collaboration. I also utilize Figma for designing intuitive user interfaces, and styled-components to bring my designs to life.

### 🌟 Projects
Check out some of my notable projects:
- [sdanundverkauf.de](https://sdanundverkauf.de) - My first website as freelancer for a client who needed a website to show live gold and silver prices based on their purity. I created this using React.js and its framework Next.js. For styling I used Figma and implemented the design using styled-components.
